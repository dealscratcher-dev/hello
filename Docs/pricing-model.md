# Retailer Pricing Model: Approve on Your Terms

## You Stay in Control  
We don't set prices — we let you decide how and when to approve a deal.

## Pricing Models You Can Use

- **Banner Price Matching**  
  Auto-approve any bid that meets your public sale or flyer price.

- **Curated bid labeling & filtering**  
We auto-label incoming bids using smart tags like “YellowTag Clearance”, “Already on promotion”, and “previous bid history”, so you can filter and respond based on what matters most to you.

- **Buyer Loyalty Discount** *(Coming Soon)*  
  Provide special deals for repeat shoppers based on bid history and wishlist patterns.

- **Custom Token Rules**  
  Set specific discount thresholds, bid windows, or category rules.

Each bid is tokenized for **one-time use** and **deal-specific only** — ensuring pricing protection and no code misuse.

## Transparency  
You can view all incoming bids in your dashboard, along with counteroffers, user requests, and product match intelligence.
