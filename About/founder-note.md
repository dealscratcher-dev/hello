# A Note from the Founder

I’ve worked in enterprise retail and analytics for 5+ years. I’ve seen how broken the pricing experience feels on both sides — for the customer, and for the retailer behind the scenes.

Dealscratcher isn’t about disrupting — it’s about repairing trust. It’s about giving everyday people a smarter way to save, and giving brands a better way to connect.

This project started as a solo build, and now it's growing with every conversation. If this resonates, I’d love to collaborate.
