# Careers at Dealscratcher

We're not building just another coupon engine.  
We're reimagining how shoppers and retailers meet — at the intersection of loyalty, intent, and pricing fairness.

Dealscratcher is early. We’re scrappy.  
But we’re building something important: a platform where the **right deal finds the right buyer**, not the loudest promotion.
