## What is Dealscratcher?
A personalized pricing engine that transforms passive flyers into dynamic deal opportunities based on how people shop.

## How is this different from Flipp or Honey?
We don't just digitize deals — we personalize pricing through engagement, loyalty signals, and shopper-brand fit.  
Unlike cashback or coupon layers, we help buyers and retailers meet in the middle.

## What’s the revenue model?
Retailer-side pricing intelligence + customer-side conversion support.  
Options include pay-per-approved-deal, tiered access, and white-label API licensing.

## What’s the go-to-market plan?
We’re starting with deal-savvy communities (RFD, price forums, loyalty forums), onboarding retailers manually to prove value on both sides.

## Is this idea defensible?
Our defensibility comes from buyer curation, retailer control, and a growing understanding of pre-purchase behavior.  
The “matchmaking” layer is hard to replicate without cultural and behavioral data.
