## What is Dealscratcher?
A personalized pricing engine that transforms passive flyers into dynamic deal opportunities based on how people shop.

## Why We Started Dealscratcher

| Perspective  | Challenge / Friction                                              | Why It Matters                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shopper   | **Pre- & Post-purchase fatigue** — flyers on Thursday, but motivation today | Reduces friction → Higher conversion at moment of intent → Better unit economics.        |
|              | **Buy Now, Pay Later regret** —  paying for a product long after the excitement fades, especially when it’s lost value or seasonal relevance (e.g. patio furniture over 18 months). | Builds trust and emotional satisfaction → Increases repeat buyers and lifetime value.    |
|              | **Price exploitation on marketplaces** — high margins, resellers, confusion   | Clearer value signals → Reduces churn → Drives brand loyalty without costly incentives.  |
| Retailer  | **Lack of visibility across market benchmarks**                                | Real-time insights → Dynamic pricing = better margin control and pricing agility.        |
|              | **Pressure to mimic eCommerce giant scale**                                          | Empowers SMEs with an efficient Go-To-Market strategy — no need for massive infrastructure or a complete website overhaul. Our platform-as-a-service model gives retailers control to define their own pricing logic, including auto-approvals for banner pricing, price-matching, and repeat-buy rewards.        |
|              | **Rigid pricing models = lost loyalty**                                       | Adaptive pricing → Stronger margins and better ROAS (Return on Ad Spend).                |


## How is this different?

Most live solutions and coupon aggregators push pre-set deals to users — generic discounts designed for the masses.

Dealscratcher flips the model:  
We pull the buyer into the deal creation — enabling intent-based bids, which the retailer can approve or decline based on their own logic.

Each Approved bid issues a personalized discount token, verified through our system.  
This creates a unique, controlled deal for that shopper — not just a public coupon.

Over time, this interaction generates pre-purchase behavioral data that helps us refine shopper personas, improve targeting, and empower retailers to build smarter pricing strategies.

## What’s the revenue model?
Our monetization is focused on **retailer-side pricing intelligence** and **customer-side conversion support** — helping brands win loyal buyers at optimized margins.

We offer:
- **Pay-per-approved-deal**: Retailers pay only when a user-submitted deal is approved, the discount token is issued, and redemption is confirmed through our system.
- **Tiered access & white-label controls**: Retailers can customize their UI, feature set, and automation rules through embedded components for bids and plugin-out logic.

## What’s the go-to-market plan?

We’re starting with deal-savvy communities — like RedFlagDeals, price forums, and loyalty subreddits — to engage high-intent shoppers who are already active in seeking better prices.

On the supply side, we’ll onboard our first 2 retailers manually to validate value on both sides of the transaction.

Shoppers will use our extension to submit bids on products they care about. Retailers can view these bids, approve the ones that align with their strategy, and optionally plug in their API to automate deal intake and response.

As retailer participation grows, we’ll feature the number of active retailers on our site to build social proof and increase adoption.

## Is this idea defensible?
Our defensibility comes from three core layers:

1. **Buyer curation**: We attract motivated, high-intent shoppers from niche communities that most platforms overlook or can’t personalize for.

2. **Retailer control**: Unlike marketplaces that commoditize sellers, we give retailers full pricing logic and deal-approval control, which builds long-term adoption and trust.

> We operate at the mercy of our network — both retailers and shoppers — and we embrace that.  
> Every bid carries value, and our system ensures it reaches the right retailer.  
> This isn’t just demand capture — it’s demand activation. And when both sides show up, the market responds.
