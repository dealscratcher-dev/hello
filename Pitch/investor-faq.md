## 🧭 Why We Started Dealscratcher

| Perspective  | Challenge / Friction                                              | Why It Matters (ROI Angle)                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shopper   | **Pre- & Post-purchase fatigue** — flyers on Thursday, but motivation today | Reduces friction → Higher conversion at moment of intent → Better unit economics.        |
|              | **Buy Now, Pay Later regret** — like patio furniture paid over 18 months     | Builds trust and emotional satisfaction → Increases repeat buyers and lifetime value.    |
|              | **Price exploitation on marketplaces** — high margins, resellers, confusion   | Clearer value signals → Reduces churn → Drives brand loyalty without costly incentives.  |
| Retailer  | **Lack of visibility across market benchmarks**                                | Real-time insights → Dynamic pricing = better margin control and pricing agility.        |
|              | **Pressure to mimic Amazon’s scale**                                          | Empowers SMEs → Efficient GTM without needing massive infra → Platform-as-a-service model scales. |
|              | **Rigid pricing models = lost loyalty**                                       | Adaptive pricing → Stronger margins and better ROAS (Return on Ad Spend).                |

## Why now in 2025

## How is this different from Flipp or Honey?
We don't just digitize deals — we personalize pricing through engagement, loyalty signals, and shopper-brand fit.  
Unlike cashback or coupon layers, we help buyers and retailers meet in the middle.

## What’s the revenue model?
Retailer-side pricing intelligence + customer-side conversion support.  
Options include pay-per-approved-deal, tiered access.

## What’s the go-to-market plan?
We’re starting with deal-savvy communities (RedFlagDeals, price forums, loyalty forums), onboarding retailers manually to prove value on both sides. Our extension would feed the product bids from shoppers and feature the count of website, allowing retailers to plug-in their api to start accessing the deals.

## Is this idea defensible?
Our defensibility comes from buyer curation, retailer control, and a growing understanding of pre-purchase behavior.  
The “matchmaking” layer is hard to replicate without cultural and behavioral data.
