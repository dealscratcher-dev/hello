We’re building a smarter way for deal-seeking customers to connect with brands offering tailored, time-sensitive pricing — where brands reward your engagement with deals tailored just for you — not the masses.

Hi, I’m Romit — founder of Dealscratcher.

Before starting this venture, I spent over five years at Home Depot Canada, leading eCommerce operations analysis, pricing behavior strategies, and customer experience optimization.

Here’s what I learned:
In retail, every new discounting strategy demands expensive development and complex integrations — and even then, customer loyalty is fragile if the brand experience isn’t consistent.

Deals and promotions aren’t enough anymore.

Loyalty is earned when brands master three things:
	•	Instant brand recognition (the 3-second memory test)
	•	Unmatched ease and convenience
	•	Memorable customer experiences worth repeating

Dealscratcher is the engine behind that loyalty.
We make pricing smarter, faster, and more loyalty-driven — without forcing retailers to rebuild their tech stacks.

Bring us your toughest pricing problems, flyer campaigns, and discount strategies —
Dealscratcher will accelerate your engagement, deepen your brand memory, and drive sustainable customer loyalty.

So I built:

- An MVP Chrome Extension (for buyers to submit deals they care about)
- FastAPI microservices with a MongoDB pipeline (feeding structured engagement data)
- A Retailer Platform Dashboard (to control approvals and track deal intelligence)

I’m wearing the **Product Architect** hat — but it's time to grow the team, refine the vision, and bring Dealscratcher to the brands and shoppers who deserve a better pricing experience.

Our mission is to lay a strong foundation for long-term economic impact — helping both brands and households win smarter, more honest pricing outcomes.

As a Shopper your choices should remain your own — just at a negotiated price.
